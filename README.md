### How to Install Node.js and npm

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. npm (Node Package Manager) is a package manager for JavaScript, essential for managing dependencies in Node.js projects. Here's how to install Node.js and npm:

1. **Download Node.js:**

   - Visit the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Choose the LTS (Long Term Support) version for stable releases or the latest version for cutting-edge features.
   - Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.

2. **Verify Node.js Installation:**

   - After the installation is complete, open your terminal or command prompt.
   - To verify that Node.js has been installed successfully, type the following command and press Enter:

     ```
     node -v
     ```

   - This command should display the version of Node.js installed on your system. If it does, Node.js installation was successful.

3. **Verify npm Installation:**

   - npm comes bundled with Node.js, so once Node.js is installed, npm is automatically installed as well.
   - To confirm that npm is installed, in your terminal or command prompt, type:

     ```
     npm -v
     ```

   - Press Enter. This command should display the version of npm installed on your system. If it does, npm installation was successful.

4. **Optional: Update npm (recommended):**

   - It's recommended to keep npm up to date to access the latest features and bug fixes.
   - To update npm to the latest version, type the following command and press Enter:

     ```
     npm install -g npm@latest
     ```

   - This command will update npm to the latest stable version globally (-g flag).

By following these steps, you have successfully installed Node.js and npm on your system. You are now ready to start building JavaScript applications and managing dependencies with npm.
